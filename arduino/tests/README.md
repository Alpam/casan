Example sketches for Arduino slave
==================================

* test-zig : show low-level usage of the ZigMsg library

Many of these are low-level test sketches for individual classes:
* test-l2addr-eth: handle basic operations on Ethernet addresses
* test-l2net-eth: send and receive Ethernet frames
* test-msg: create and manipulate messages objects with options (without access to the network)
* test-time: handle basic operations on time
* test-res: simulate a response to a request (without access to the network)

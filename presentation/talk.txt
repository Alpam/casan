Presentation

The arduino development board

the ~ symbols are to indicate that we can simulate analog output with these
digital pins by setting power on and off quickly

...
and there is a lot more components we can get

9v battery snap
Potentiometer 10kilohm
alphanumeric LCD

we can modify this electronic component as we modify an opensource code
no pre-require knowledge

when the arduino is connected to a powersource, it runs

COMPONENTS
	a breadboard
	wooden base, pushbuttons, diodes, leds, wires
	several resistors (and resistance values), capacitors
	photo and temperature sensors
	motors, transistors, â€¦


USAGE
